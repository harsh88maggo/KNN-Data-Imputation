# KNN-Data-Imputation
This repository contains an implementation of missing value imputation using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach. The project demonstrates how to handle missing data in a dataset, perform imputation using sklearn's KNNImputer, and visualize the distribution of imputed vs. observed values to assess imputation quality.
